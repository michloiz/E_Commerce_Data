#E-Commerce Data Analysis Report

**Author:** Michalis Loizos  
**Date:** June 2025  

This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset (from Kaggle) to uncover key business insights related to revenue trends, customer demographics, and purchasing patterns. It is part of my personal portfolio and aims to demonstrate my ability to clean, process, analyze, and visualize real-world data using SQL, R, and Tableau.



## Project Goals

- Clean and pre-process transactional e-commerce data
- Explore revenue trends over time (monthly and hourly)
- Identify the most profitable customer segments and products
- Provide actionable recommendations based on findings


## Tools Used

- **BigQuery SQL** — Data filtering and aggregation
- **R** — Data wrangling & visualization (`tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `lubridate`)
- **Tableau** — Interactive charts (country-level revenue & customers)
- **R Markdown  — Report generation (PDF output)
